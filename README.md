# Neural Network in the C Language

This repository was created to deepen my understanding of neural networks, enhance my programming skills, and gain experience in building libraries in C.

## Description

This project implements a library named **Synapse** for constructing various MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) architectures in C/C++. The library is optimized for fast training of large models and offers flexibility for easily adjusting hyperparameters. By adhering to encapsulation within the projectâ€™s modules, the library simplifies usage while maintaining full control over the training process.

## Installation

To clone this repository, execute the following bash command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/profjuvii/neural-net-from-scratch.git
```

## Navigation

The repository is organized into several folders, each serving a specific purpose:

- **datasets**: Stores raw dataset archives before preprocessing. These files are used by the preparation scripts to generate CSV inputs for training.
- **mnist_preparation**: Includes a Python script for preparing handwritten digit data from the MNIST dataset in CSV format.
- **mnist_training**: Contains code for training a model on pre-processed MNIST data.
- **models**: Stores pre-trained models.
- **synapse**: Contains the core neural network library.

To train your own model, ensure that the necessary compiler extensions are included as follows:

```bash
-I../synapse/include -L../synapse/lib -lsynapse
```

## Requirements for Training the MNIST Model

To run the code for training a neural network on handwritten MNIST data, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare MNIST Data**:
   - In the `mnist_preparation/` folder, you need set up a Python virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the necessary library:
     ```bash
     pip install idx2numpy
     ```
   - After this, you can run the MNIST data preparation script:
     ```bash
     python mnist2csv.py
     ```

2. **Build and Run the Training Code**:
   - In the `mnist_training/` folder, run the following command to compile the code:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - Once the build is complete, execute the program using:
     ```bash
     ./train
     ```

Once these steps are completed, the training of the neural network on the MNIST dataset will begin as intended.

Thanks to the hyperparameter settings defined in the code, I achieved an accuracy of 94.2%. The trained model has been saved in the `models/` folder.
